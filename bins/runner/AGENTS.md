# Runner Binary

The **Runner** is a critical binary that executes deployment operations in customer infrastructure. Unlike other
binaries, it runs as an executable in both Kubernetes containers and cloud VMs (AWS, Azure, GCP), providing secure
execution of deployments in customer environments.

## Binary Overview

The Runner is the execution engine that runs within customer infrastructure to perform deployments, manage
infrastructure state, and execute workflows. It operates in customer-controlled environments while maintaining secure
communication with the Nuon control plane.

## Architecture

- **Language**: Go
- **Deployment**: Kubernetes containers and cloud VMs (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- **Execution Model**: Job-based execution with lifecycle management
- **Security**: Operates within customer security boundaries
- **Communication**: Secure API communication with Nuon control plane
- **State Management**: Manages Terraform state, Helm releases, and deployments

## Relationship to Other Services

- **API Communication**: Communicates with `ctl-api` Runner API endpoints
- **Job Execution**: Executes jobs queued by the control plane
- **State Reporting**: Reports execution status and results back to platform
- **Customer Infrastructure**: Operates within customer cloud accounts
- **Security Bridge**: Provides secure execution in customer environments
